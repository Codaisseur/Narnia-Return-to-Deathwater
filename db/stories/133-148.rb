  Loridan interrupts your thoughts to say, "Shall we sail
  round the island once, so that you might get a clearer picture
  of where you are going?"

  "Oh, yes, thank you, captain," you answer, but it is not only
  because you want to see more of Deathwater; you are also
  delaying the inevitable start of your adventure.

  Loridan orders the ship to take an easterly course around
  the island. The waters of the easternmost side are filled with
  sharp crags, and the waterlogged remnants of a shipwreck
  cling to these teeth. The wood of the wreck is black, and you
  wonder if it was once a Calormene pirate ship. Also from this
  side, you can see that the eastern stream pours out of a tiny lake
  high up on the mountain's side.

  The shipcontinues on to the north of the island, and you spy
  the first sign of life just off the shore.; A small sailboat lies
  anchored a few feet from the beach with a crude gangplank
  connecting the deck to the sand.

  Cheekimeek comes to your side, and says, "Now that looks
  like a good place to start solving a mystery. Shall we land here
  on the north side, or would you prefer the south?"

  You cannot leave the Calormene here to die, so you quickly
  undo his ropes, Rubbing his sore wrists,  Paksha Tarkaan rises
  to his feet.
  Nodding wisely, he says, "I thank you, child, for your
  greatness of heart, and you. Mouse of valour, for your keen
  wit. My men (may Tash punish them for an eternity) heard
  rumours of gold on this island and committed mutiny. The
  jackals knocked me unconscious and left me here to perish I
  seek to bring the faithless ones to justice if I may. Before
  I return to them in vengeance, how may i repay you, my saviors?

  Paksha Tarkaan has nothing that does not now belong to you
  Ask and it shall be yours."

  "Can you tell us anything about the island?" you ask,
  hoping to solve some of the mystery with the kind
  Calormene's help.

  "Alas, my kowledge concerning this isle is poor. The
  waters of the lake outside and the stream that pours forth from
  it have the cursed power to turn all things immersed to gold.

  "Within this mountain crawls a labyrinthine maze of caverns.
  Only Tash can say what dwells at the heart of the cursed
  peak. If yÂ° u tru ly w ' sn 10 explore the shadowy depths, the
  portal beneath the earth is the second cave from this one.
  Would that I had more mysteries to reveal to you!'

  "Thank you, sir," says Cheekimeek, bowing. "The rela-
  tionship between our two countries has always been, shall we
  say, strained? Today has given me new faith in the goodness
  of people everywhere and new hope for a better future. If you
  require any assistance in dealing with your men, you will find
  the Zephyr Reginalis anchored on the south side of the island.
  Tell the captain you are our friend, and hewill lend his aid."

  "I, too, have great hopes for the future, wise friends,"
  Paksha says. "Come now. Let us leave our dark prison and
  return to the golden sunshine beyond."

  Together you leave the small cave, passing onto a narrow
  ledge outside. A small lake spreads before you (very bright
  after the darkness of the cave) surrounded on three sides by
  low bluffs. Paksha points to three other cave openings and
  reminds you that it is the second one from the cave you just left
  that leads into the underground complex.

  "Farewell, kind and gentle friends! May Tash bring us
  together again very soon," says Paksha, before disappearing
  beyond the lake.

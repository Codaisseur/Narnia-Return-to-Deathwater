  You stand by the natural dam of the azure lake where the
  eastern stream takes its first leap through a narrow opening in
  the rock wall. The lake is surrounded on the other three sides
  by low cliffs topped with coarse grass. Four black caves are
  lined against the farthest cliff face, hinting at dark, under-
  ground adventures. A ledge leads past these caves to a natural
  staircase that climbs to the top of the cliffs.

  The water of the small lake is deep and crystal clear. Blue
  stones cover its bottom, but that's not all. Something else ties
  on the stony floor near the center. As you stare into the water,
  the sun comes out from behind a cloud, and the object takes
  on a lusterous glow. It's the statue of a man lying on his face
  with his arms stretched out in front of him, and he's made out
  of solid gold!

  "Hmm," mummbles Cheekimeek, "Two streams, one

  stream, row up the west stream, or land on the bay's beach in
  the middle. Which will it be then, child?"

  chamber, you find not one, but three large dogs lying on piles
  of clean straw. >

  "Have you brought us something to eat?" one of the dogs
  asks, opening a sleepy eye. Apparently he was expecting
  someone else, for when he sees you, he leaps to his feet,
  growling, the hairs on his back standing briskly at attention.
  The other two dogs (one brown, the other gray ) join in at their
  brother's side. They seem to be in no mood for explanations
  and eye you hungrily. You swallow hard, as Cheekimeek
  stifles a little squeak.

  Walking around to the door on the western (or so you guess)
  side of the tower, you witness an even more beautiful sight
  than the golden edifice itself. Carved into the door (which
  itself is black as night) is the delicate image of a woman more
  fair than any you know from your own world. She is tail and
  slender, with hair that seems to float above her shoulders. The
  portrait sheds an unearthly, heavenly light, making her beauty
  even more extraordinary.

  For a long white, you and Cheek imeek stand riveted before
  the image, unable to speak a word for fear of disturbing the
  woman. Then the Mouse suggests quietly, "Perhaps, we
  should see if it opens."

  Slowly and respectfully, you approach the door. Finding no
  handle any where, you give it a gentle push. The smooth, black
  material does not budge, even though you try harder a second
  time. Cheekimeek puts his shoulder to the door, and together
  you try a third time, but you cannot move it. Defeated, you rest
  from your efforts while the image of the woman smiles
  enigmatically down upon you.

  Suddenly a thought pops into your head. "A password!*'
  you say. "A door like this would definitely have a very special
  password. If we can say it, then it will probably open."

  "You might be right there, child," declares the Mouse. "But
  what could it be? I must admit I'm not very good at guessing."

  Desperately, you try to recall every story you've ever read
  where the hero faced a magic door. After a few moments, you
  have to give up. You put your head against the rough stone of
  the cave wall and close your eyes to shut out your failure. If
  only Asian were here to help you! The Lion's loving image
  fills your mind's eye. Your lips shape a soundless request for
  his help. Pick a number and add your Inner Strength bonus:

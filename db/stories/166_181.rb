You don't want to slay the Dwarfs,
but you do plan to get some information before you leave.

"Tell us what you know about the island,"

you demand, surprising yourself about your confidence
(even if they are tied up, the Dwarfs appear dangerous).

"We don't know much," says the leader."We just guard the place for our master, Razmon.
If you're after his gold, I suggest you turn your back now. He keeps a terrible dragon
inside the mountain. But if you insist on going in, then look for the entrance on the southern
side of the island, about halfway up the mountain between the two streams.
That's all we know, honest." Pick a number and add your perception bonus.

  The eastern stream leaps down from the mountain in
  flashing cascades and rushing Whitewater. Even the water at
  the mouth, which is calmer, is barely wide or deep enough for
  yourtiny rowboat. Panting, you paddle against the current just
  the same.

  "I must be getting old," Cheekimeek says, "This oar of
  mine weighs a ton!"

  You notice that your own paddle has become exceptionally
  heavy as well. Raising the oar out of the water, you can hardly
  believe what you see. The lower half of the oar, the half you
  had in the water, has turned into pure gold!

  "Cheekimeek!" you cry out. "The water has turned our oars
  into gold! If it will do this to everything, that may be why this
  place is called Deathwater!"

  "No doubt you are right," says the Mouse nervously. "And
  if it turns everything it touches to gold, then the bottom of this
  boat must be undergoing the same change."

  As Cheekimeek squeeks, the boat starts to sink rapidly.

  Your growling stomach has made the decision for you
  Without fear (for what is there to fear from gingerbread?) you
  open the door wider and cross the threshold It is, indeed, a
  kitchen on the other side, but one that seems ti be made for
  children. The table in the center is low, with tiny stools all
  around it. Even the stove is small. Then the cook comes out
  from behind a cupboard, and everything is clear to you. He is
  a Dwarf!



  The red haired little man carries a bag of flour over his
  shoulder and whistles a merry tune. He does not seem alarmed
  to find you in his kitchen, but tips his high, leather hat to you
  in greeting and sings out, "Hello! Are you lost, or have you
  come for lunch?"

  You are delighted to find such a friendly person in these
  cold caves, and tell the Dwarf freely of your mission.

  -Mysteries?" questions the Dwarf. "I didn't know there
  were any mysteries on the island, other than the master
  himself- He keeps himself locked away in that tower all day.
  Of course, I thought everybody knew about the water: how the
  eastern stream turns things to gold and the western one turns
  them back again. Not really worth coming all this way just to
  find that out! Would you like something to eat?"

  Without hesitation, you accept a large bowl of thick slew
  (Cheekimeek's is somewhat smal ler). The meal isdeliciously
  satisfying, but your mind is filled with questions.

  Who is this Razmon? Why does he stay locked up in a tower
  all day? Is he responsible for the magic water? Is he just a
  greedy old man living on a mountain of gold? You try to get
  some answers from the cook, but he seems more interested in
  how you like his stew and gives you no further clues.




  At last, you take your leave, thanking the Dwarf heartily for
  all he has given you. You stalk down the corridor, suspecting
  it might lead the way to Razmon's tower (if such a thing can
  be called a tower underground). Check Key 10 If you haven ' t
  already. Turn to 306.

  While Cheekimeek fashions a simple torch from a nearby
  bayberry bush, you examine the peculiar characteristics of the
  four dark openings.
  the one furthest to the left squats nearly level with the
  surface of the lake, while the second one rises above its
  neighbor with a natural stone step of at least a foot. The third
  one is interesting, for you can almost imagine a door being
  placed in its high, regular shape. Indeed, the way the ledge juts
  out in front might almost be very proper front stoop. The fourth
  one is not so nice as the others, being more of a crack than
  an opening and having dry, brown moss hanging from roof.

  -Which cave shall we explore first?" Cheekimeek asks,
  inspecting his torch with satisfaction.

  "Perhaps we'll find out what they're up to if we listen to
  what they are saying," you observe. You lean closer and cup
  a hand to your ear. Fortunately, none of the pirates knows how
  to talk below the level of a shout and their words reach you
  clearly.
  "O, lice of a thousand camels. hasten thy sluggish limbs!"
  bellows the one with the sword (the one doing no work at all
  himself). "O, rats of a thousand fleets of warships, before Tash
  the terrible and divine puts out the sun this evening, thee shall
  complete this raft of labor of forfeit even one beetle's share of
  gold."
  "Te poets, whose minds are far sharper than your sword,
  say let not the lion's share go to the one who roars the loudest.
  The gold belongs to all of us," protests another, rising to his
  feet."Were we not in accord that none should order another,
  but all have authority alike?"
  "I, O foolhardy cousin, possessed the only mind of sufficient
  sharpness to remember that a weaponless man is a slave.
  And slaves posses the authority of an ass. My sword is not
  soft, useless gold, but wicked steel. I command here!" snarls
  the first man, drawing his blade threateningly.
  A few are frightened by this vulgar display; the others grow
  angrier and rise to their feet. A fight may break out at any
  moment, and you don't know if you want to be around to
  witness it. Yet you are intrigued by their talk of gold. Certainly,
  this is the one of the mysteries you were sent here to solve!

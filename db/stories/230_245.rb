"Golly!" you say to the captain. "I'd like that."

Loridan laughs good naturedly (his spirits seem to have
brightened since his brush with death) and orders two crew-
men to help you up the thick rope webbing that serves as a
ladder to the ship's towering crow's nest. You seem to be on
top of the world, as you sway to and fro at this great height.
Peering toward the horizon in all directions, you keep a sharp
look-out for the sight of land. Pick a number and add your

  Cheekimeek seems relieved (he was rather afraid that you
  were going to ask him to climb the ivy), and asks cheerily
  which direction you will try next.

You and Cheekimeek are lowered to the water in a small
rowboat. Loridan tells you that the Zephyr Reginalis will be
anchored in the bay on the south side. Cries of good luck reach
your ears as you work the oars, and the two vessels part slowly
like good friends. Within a few minutes you have pulled the
row boat behind some bayberry bushes clumped along the
shore, the Zephyr Reginalis is gone from view.

"Well, child," Cheekimeek says with a light in his eyes,
"our adventure begins."

You find yourself filled with fear and delight at the
Mouse's words.

better, then we can always turn back later. All right?"

  Poking about the desk, you find the usual things: paper, ink,
  and some pens. In the drawer, along with some diagrams of
  the night sky , rests a small, leather-bound book (which proves
  to be a journal of some sort when you flip through it). Its cover
  bears the image of a very beautiful star. You show the contents
  of the drawer to MacTwitter, who says, "Aye. Twas said the
  master was passin' fond of stargazin'. I don't s'pose he has
  much time for that anymore, though, what with strikin' it rich
  and all."

  Poor man, you think to yourself, locked away in some old
  mountain, leaving all his dreams behind for the cold pleasures
  of gold.

  "Well," says Cheekimeek, "let's have a look inside that
  journal. Maybe we can learn something that will help us solve
  this mystery."

Cheekimeek tries to persuade you not to take the gold.
(Could it be he wants it all for himself?) You turn your back
on him and rush to the pile of treasure in the shade. As you
stuff your pockets with chunks of the precious metal, you
suddenly feel very alone.

Turning around, you find you are alone. All the others have
gone. No, not quite alone. As you wonder, Asian paces toward
you along the beach. His eyes are sad and his terrible, heavy
paws move slowly. '

"Child, how will mere gold solve the mysteries of Death-,
water? How will a metal fulfill the hopes and needs of your '
friends back at Cair Paravel? How will glitter restore a cursed
stream to life?" the Lion's voice deepens with each question.

"I don't know," you whisper. "How?"

"Dear heart, gold cannot replace the warmth and wonder of
tove and trust. You know the value of friendship and loyalty
in your deepest soul. But, young one, you forget so easily!
Strive to remember me better!" Asian's gentle tone rises to a
roar. You are sad, ashamed, and suddenly very dizzy. Asian's
face swims before you, and then all is black. You awaken on
the floor of the museum, surrounded by your classmates.

Walking through the shimmering shade of the woods, you

quite recently. Their stumps are freshly cut, and a wide path
of crushed grass leads away to the east.

"What's been going on here?" you ask the Mouse.

"I do not rightly know, child,"he says, "but the answer most
likely lies along that path."

Peeking through some leaves, you are surprised to findfo
narrow path running more or less due south. You fight your
way through the intervening briars, and walk along the
smooth ground for a few yards. The brambles seem to open
up before you, and you travel with ease. "You were right,
Cheek! I looked, and here's a path."

"Yes," says the Mouse, walking thoughtful beside you,,
"but the question is: who could have made this path in the first
place?"

You had not thought of that before, and now that you have,
you are filled with dread. What sort of animals might live on
this island? Do they have anything to do with the mystery of
Deathwater? Just then, there is a loud commotion in the briars
to the right of you. Something has been startled, and is
running away to the west.

Cheekimeek draws his rapier in a flash and asks, "Do we :
give chase?"

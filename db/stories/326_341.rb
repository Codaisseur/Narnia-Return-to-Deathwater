    scramble to Cheekimeek's side, and soon you are both free.

    "Well done, child," says the Mouse. "We had better take a

    Cautiously, you approach the figure slumped in the shad-

    "Walking slowly past the lion (was it a trick of the light, or
    did it wink at you?), you slip behind the curtain. The heavy
    cloth brushes against your back as you feel blindly along the
    wall for a door. You edge toward what you imagine must be
    the middle of the curtain, and still you find nothing. Surely,
    there must be an opening somewhere, you think to yourself,
    and continue to inch along the wall. Smooth marble slips past
    your fingertips; you reach the other end and emerge dusty and
    bewildered."

    "Your confusion turns to astonishment, however, when y 0u
    find that the museum alcove has apparently become the hall
    of some magnificent castle, and the curtain a rich and lovely
    tapestry. The hall is long and high, pillared on both sides, and
    adorned with banners. More magnificent still are the people
    assembled there. Men, women and children dressed in the
    fine, yet simple garb of lords and ladies stand at the far end
    with their backs to you. How wonderfully strange it all seems.
    But how did you get here? Could it be you slipped through a
    doorway behind the curtain without knowing it? Suddenly,
    you feel as though you are intruding on something very
    solemn and private."

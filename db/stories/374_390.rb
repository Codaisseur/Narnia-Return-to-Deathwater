problems remain, they will work themselves out over time.
Meanwhile, it is time for you to return home. Now, give me

You bury your face in the lion 's deep mane. Its rich weight
soothes your heart and eases your spirit. You know that when
you are frightened or lonely, the Lion's warm presense will

Moments later, you find yourself back in the museum. With
the adventure still fresh in your heart, you hurry off to rejoin
your class and await the day when you will return to Narnia.

Skulking from pillar to pillar, you sneak down to the other
end of the hall. Several nobles cluster at one column; you
marvel at the fineness of their features and the fairness of their
skin. Then you spot something truly unbelievable: a large
beaver standing on its hind legs and wearing a green and black
checked vest! So strange, and yet somehow familiar. And then
from somewhere it comes to you. Narnia! Could this really be
the place Eustace told you about?

The lords and ladies form a circle around a thin old m atl
dressed in a shiny black robe (not unlike those worn by oid er
students during commencement). The man seems very
puzzled, and tugs his scanty beard while muttering, "I $ Q
apologize, your majesty. I must have put too much root of
Asparagum into the powder. The child should have appeared
right here. Why, I'm not fit to be called the Head Magician of
Narnia!"

So it is Narnia ! You wonder if the child the old man referred
to could be you. Then another voice says, "Do not blame
yourself, Volmar. There is little we can do in these matters if
Asian himself does not wish it to be so. Perhaps we must leave
this baffling mystery unsolved for the present."

You cannot see who spoke, but the voice was a young one.
Probably, it was the King to whom the old man was talking.
At any rate, there is little doubt in your mind that you are the
one they mean, and you find yourself torn between fleeing and
introducing yourself to them.

You have entered yet another cave, but this one is a cave
with a difference! It contains the most stunningsight you have
ever seen in your life. In the very center of the vaulted cavern,
rising from floor to ceiling, gleams a perfectly round tower
made entirely of gold bricks! The candles on the surrounding
walls dance and glint off of the burnished metal, fascinating
and hypnotizing you to dizziness.

Two golden spigots ornament the tower's walls near the
floor: one on the north side, the other on the south. From these
pour forth two streams into channels that run in either direc-
tion out of the cave. A door on the western side of the tower
draws your fleeting attention. For the moment, you are too
awed by the spectacle of the gold edifice itself to inspect the
portal more closely. Imagine the wealth that is piled before
you!

Cheekimeek notices your fascination, and shakes you
while saying, "Do not be taken in by its spell, child. It only
looks warm. The truth is, I pity the man who has to live behind
those walls."

You come out of your trance. It does seem rather sad, now
that you think about it, to seem to have so much when really
you have nothing. Suddenly, you want more than ever to end
this adventure and return to your friends back at Cair Paravel.

The gull sails his ship around to the south side of the island,
where you see the Zephyr Reginalis still anchored and board
the grander ship.

It is a relief to be back on board the Zephyr Reginalis,
sailing for Narnia, but it is also something of a disappoint-
ment. Nobody on the ship seems very happy, and the loss of
adventure is an emptiness in your stomach. The days pass
slowly, and the sadness increases as the forsaken isle of
Deathwater falls further behind.

When you finally arrive at Cair Paravel, King Favian asks
some uncomfortable questions: "Did you find the lost LorcP
Did find the cause of the curse? Did you solve the mystery of
the poem? Did you..."

"NoPyou interrupt, not wanting to hear a detailed list ofiall
the things you did not do on Deathwater. "Oh, I 'm sorry! Is it
too late to return to the island? I want to solve the mystery, I
really do!"

"I'm afraid it is too late," says a deep voice behind you:
Turning, you see that it is Asian who spoke. "It is time for you
to go home. Perhaps someday you will be ready to return to
Narnia. Until then, farewell, child!"

You start to protest, but your whole body feels a mighty tug,
and things go black for a moment. When you can see again,
you find yourself back in themuseum. With a heavy heart, you
shuffle off to find your classmates, and await the day when
you might return to Narnia.

In their haste, the Dwarfs fumble with their clubs, dropping

their hands and knees, but grow calmer when you stand
quietly and make no hostile gestures.

you're not supposed to be here, child," says one. "What is

"I've come from Narnia at the command of King Favian to
solve the mystery of this island. Can you help me?" you ask.

"Hmm..." says the Dwarf. "You'll want to talk to our
master, Razmon, about that. Wait here, and I'll see if he will
talk with anyone. Mind you, he's a very private person, and
doesn't like having guests drop in uninvited."

There is a sad look in the Dwarf's eyes, that makes you
wonder about this man called Razmon. You and Cheekimeek
are left with the three other Dwarfs who return to their game
at the table, giving you the perfect opportunity to sneak away.

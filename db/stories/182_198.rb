"Don't panic," says the Mouse, rushing to your side.

Cheekimeek is very brave, but also very small, and the dog
leaps right over him to get at you. Never before have you been
so frightened, and you freeze, not knowing what else to do.
The beast jumps on you with a snarl, and you fall to the
ground, hitting your head on a rock. As you drift off into
unconsciousness, you see the dog raise his head to give a
triumphant howl.

  What a wet place Deathwater is! You walk into a small cave
  seems to be filled with the dancing reflections of a small
  pool in its center. A merrily bubbling stream flows in from a
  passage opposite you to feed the pool. Its clear water seems to
  invite you to wash away all the dust of your adventure and be
  refreshed.

Removing it immediately from the water, you are shocked to
find that your finger has turned to pure gold!

"Cheekimeek, help! you shout! "Look what's happened to me"

"Don't panic," says the Mouse, rushing to your side.
"There must be a cure somewhere. Oh, me! I can see why they
call this place Deathwater. Imagine if one of us had fallen in!" (checked Key 10)

You had begun to develop a rather bad impression of Razmon, what with the curse and the gold and all. But seeing him has changed all that. There is something sad. yet tender about the man standing at the well. You listen quietly to what he is saying. "let me tell you again, my radiance." He murmurs softly into the water, "about the day when i shall free you from your water cell, and you will rise to shine brightly once more. How all the curses will come to an end and how happily together we shall live out our remaining days in this paradise that was once our prison".
What peculiar talk! Could it be that the magician is a bit crackers? You are almost convinced of this, when something makes you stop cold. A voice rises up from the well: a voice so far away and mournful that is nearly wrenches your heart right of your body to hear it. "Oh, Razmon" The silvery voice sings, "every day you come to me and speak of my realse; every day for years and years! but do you do it"? Do i at this moment, walk freely where i will, as is my due? Or do i set here yet, Waiting for the day that will never come? Oh, Razmon, do you not think me beautifull, more beautiful than any of Aslan's creations? You have said you do. Well than, forget this talk of curses and dreams for the future. What good are they to me? Forget the ache in your back and your tired eyes. Workm, Razmon, work for my release! Can the world go on without me?

A harch mistress, indeed, you think to yourself. At this paurse in the curious converstaion you decide that it is time to let you presence be known.

Oh. no! You"ve slipped! "'Cheeeeeeeeeeeek!" you cry as
you slide faster and faster away from your friend. You fall for
what seems like hours, always waiting to finally hit bottom,
but you never do.

Eventually, the wall begins to curve under you, slowing
your descent until you are sliding along a nearly horizontal
surface (tike you do on your dining room floor at home). You
wonder when this trip is going to end, and if you are ever going
to see daylight again, when something heavy brushes across
your face like a curtain. â– .

On the other side there is light. You have returned to the
museum, spinning to a halt before the display of the stuffed
Lion. Of course, now you know it is Asian, He says, "Fate has
returned you to your own world before you could finish your
adventure. Do not worry. Someday you will return to com-
plete it. Until then, fulfill my quest here! Learn to know me by
my other name! Farewell, dear heart!"

Giving the lion one last hug, you head back to your
classmates, eager to tell Eustace of your adventures and to
wait for the day when you wil! return.

  "Excuse me, sir," you say in a clearing-your- throat fash ion.

  Raznion jumps at the sound, doing a fine impression of a
  dancing marionette. For all the surprise on his features, you
  wo uld think a winged elephant had suddenly popped into the
  room, rather than a Mouse and a child.

  â€¢'Great glowing heavens!" he cries, grasping the edgeof the
  we tl for support. "Who are you?"

  -I've come from Namia to investigate the mystery of
  Deathwater," you reply, though you have grown rather tired
  of explaining yourself all the time.

  "Mystery?" says the magician with a poorly fashioned look
  of innocence on his face. He repeats the word several times (to
  let you know he has no idea what you could be talking about)
  and positions himself between you and the well to hide it.

  "Yes, mystery," you continue. "Our search has uncovered
  many questions, and they have led us here to you. Now, we
  don't want to pry, but we have reason to believe that you and
  your island pose a threat to people and animals everywhere."

  "Threat?" says Razmon with a worried took. "Oh, no, no,
  no! Not that! I mean, that's not exactly right."

  "Besides," you add, "it looks as though your are badly in
  need of a friend,"

  "Ah, you're right there, child," he mutters, looking mourn-
  fully at the floor. "Yes, I 've kept my secret too long, and it has
  become heavy. Come, then. If it is answers you want, you
  shall have them. But if you are looking for solutions, I'm
  afraid I can be of little help."

  Razmon's words are not terribly encouraging, but at last
  you feel as though you are getting somewhere. The magician
  steps around to the other side of the well, and motions for you
  to come over. "I want you to meet my greatest secret, and even
  greater lovc.Abadin."

  Obeying h.s gestures, you peer into the well. It iS P erf ectJ

  so clear that you hardly notice it a. all, and seem to be gazi *
  down a long tunnel filled with a shimmering b!ue light 2

  It .s a woman just like the one on the door, but mo*
  beaut,ful because she is l.ving. She, too, seems quite aware
  her beauty, and assumes several dainty poses to please her two
  new admirers at the top of her well.

  You are jus, wondering how i, is that she can be alive down
  here, and what that light is tha, seems ,o radiate from he
  body when Cheekimeek says, "My whiskers, that's a star-
  Indeed, says Razmon, beaming with pride. "A star not
  seen ,â€ž the nigh, sky for many a yea," He anticipates you
  questions and continues. "She fell to earth ages ago, i ng
  before ether of you were born, and was swallowed up by this
  dead volcano of an island. The underground lake ,n wLn she
  landed bubbled forth to form the two streams. Obviously
  strong magic was involved, for many curses followed The
  -stern stream turns everything it touches to gold, and though
  the western stream has the power to restore these unfortu-
  nates, there are few who know about it." k
  "What's the other curse?" you ask. â– 'â– 
  "Ah, tha,, my child, is the worst of all. Abadin is trapped

  he heavens condemned ,o spend etemi,y underground"

  .more powerful than even I feared, and the solution beyond â– 
  me. You seem a clever sort, child; at leas, you were cLer
  nough to find me. Do you think you could free Abad.n f om
  her watery prison?"

  "Think, child, think!" cries the woman's voice from deep
  beneath the water. "My beauty fades with every moment tha,
  I pass at the bottom of this horrid well ! Surely , you can see that
  a loveliness such as mine was not meant to be locked away,
  but free to roam at will and be admired by all that bear witness
  to it!"

  Proud words to say the least! Still, you do want to help.
  Little hope flutters in your heart or in the eyes of the magician.
  Almost, you are about to tell the magician that you are sorry,
  but you can think of nothing. Yet suddenly, you do think of
  something, and a very important something at that.

  The dream poem that King Favian recited back at Cair
  Paravet rushes back into your mind with perfect clarity. It has
  proven to be of little use , but now perhaps it will give you an
  answer! Ignoring everything else, you concentrate on the
  poem, trying to eke out some solution from its mysterious
  rhyme.

  Here is the poem for you to read again:

  Coursing darkly through the night.

  Onward in her jealous flight,

  Makes herself a prison tigh t,

  Prison far from sky and light.

  Argent water, golden curse.

  Seeks the peace, but makes things worse.

  Seeks the peace in Self immersed,

  Immersed like clues within the verse.

  Only look and you shall see,

  Nothing else can set her free.
